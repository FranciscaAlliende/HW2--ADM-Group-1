# HW2-ADM-Group-1
This repository contains the results of the Homework 2 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining.

The collaborators of this homework were Francisca Alliende and Yousef Abbar. Diletta Abbonato, was part of our group on the beginning, but unfortunately she could not contribute to the homework due to family problems, giving notice to the rest of the group on time and properly.

On the other hand, the remaining members of the group decide to divide the homework as follows:
* Francisca Alliende --> RQ2, RQ3, RQ5 and CRQ1
* Yousef Abbar -->  RQ1, RQ4 and CRQ2

As a result, we have a Jupiter book that contains all the work done by both of us, except the chropleth map of question CRQ2 which for technical reasons is in jpeg format, and not in an html file or directly in the Jupiter Noteboook, as would be ideal.

Originally, each question was answered in a different Jupiter notebook to facilitate its manipulation due to the amount of data. Unfortunately we did not foresee that this was not the best stategy for the final submition of this homework. We apologize then, for the duplication of information and for the heavyness of the file.

The databases used in this analysis where from the TLC Trip Record Data http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml,
specifically, we used the data from 2018, for the months avalaible at the time that where from january to june. With the aim of getting the information about the boroughs, we used the Taxi Zone Lookup Table.
