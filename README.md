# HW2-ADM-Group-1
This repository contains the results of the Homework 2 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining.

The collaborators of this homework were Francisca Alliende and Yousef Abbar. Diletta Abbonato, was part of our group on the beginning, but unfortunately she could not contribute to the homework due to family problems, giving notice to the rest of the group on time and properly.

On the other hand, the remaining members of the group decide to divide the homework as follows:
* Francisca Alliende --> RQ2, RQ3, RQ5 and CRQ1
* Yousef Abbar -->  RQ1, RQ4 and CRQ2

As a result, we have a Jupiter book that contains all the work done by both of us.
